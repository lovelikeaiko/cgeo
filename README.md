[c:geo](http://www.cgeo.org) is an open source, full-featured, always ready-to-go client for geocaching.com (unofficial) and offers basic support for other geocaching platforms.

## So what I am going to do?
-  Change the Cgeo UI from Holo style to Material style.
-  Change the Map API in Cgeo to the newest version. Currently Cgeo is using old google map api and mapsforge map api. I found Cgeo is already add new mapsforge api, but as an optional choise. I need to rearrange the whole interface structure for moving everything to new api.
-  Add some Chinese map providers to make every thing are familiar to some Chinese user. This need correct the coordinates.
-  Add some useful functions like **Close Alarm**, **Voice Navigation**.

## Current progress
-  added Close Alarm function in master branch.
